--------- How to make a nicely formatted .biom file from mothur data ----------------------

# use make.biom on mothur with subsampled stability file and normal constaxonmy file to make .biom

mothur > make.biom( shared=tability.an.0.03.subsample.0.03.shared, constaxonomy=stability.an.cons.taxonomy) 

# will make a file called something like 
stability.an.0.03.subsample.0.03.biom

# quit mothur

# All of this was done using bioinformatics computer in FEM lab where biom convert was already installed

# cd to the folder containing your .biom file then run this script

biom convert -i stability.an.0.03.subsample.0.03.biom -o table.from_biom_w_taxonomy.txt --to-tsv --header-key taxonomy

#  where -i means name of input file and -o is whatever name you want to give to output file

# (names for your files might be different to what i put in that example script but everything else should be the same)

# Now you can read the resulting .txt file into excel and it should look nice -> samples in columns and final column
# should be your taxonomy info. 

# You may need to delete the first row as this is usually just empty except for a # and some few words
# also change the name of OTU ID column before reading into R -> normally it gives a space in the name 
# which will make problems in R so remove it.
