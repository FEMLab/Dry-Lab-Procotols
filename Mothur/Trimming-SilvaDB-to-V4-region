## Code for finding out region of Silva database to align sequences against, based on primers used
## used ccoling's input from this forum to help
## http://www.mothur.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2498
## you will need to download the most recent version of silva db from here:
# https://www.mothur.org/wiki/Silva_reference_files
# unzip it and take out of subfolder (see below)

## 1) Create a directory containing mothur.exe etc and silva zip file unzipped and out of any subfolders (so Mothur can find them)

## 2) Create the following two fasta files and place in same directory:


## a) A file containing a number of sequences of bacterial (or archael, as appropriate) in fasta format - I used one ecoli.
## got ecoli fasta sequence from here 
## http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/174375?report=fasta
## saved as ecoli16.fasta

## b) A file containing your primer sequences (called an 'oligo' file) -> go into note pad and enter primer sequences
# as follows:

forward GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA
reverse GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT
## ie seqs for 515f and 806r (without barcodes!)


## save as 'pcrTest.oligos' -> then run an in silico PCR to get 'amplicon' your primers align to the E. coli 16S sequence: 
pcr.seqs(fasta=ecoli16.fasta, oligos=pcrTest.oligos)

# ecoli16.pcr.fasta will be one of out put files: this should contain the sequence of the 'amplicon' created using 
# which ever primers you input. 

# then align this amplicon sequence against the whole database - in this case used silva v119 database. 
# reference can also be a fasta file, as in the SOP

align.seqs(fasta=ecoli16.pcr.fasta, reference=silva.nr_v119.align)


# run summary seqs to see where it aligns to get start/stop position for next command

summary.seqs(fasta=ecoli16.pcr.align)


Start	End	NBases	Ambigs	Polymer	NumSeqs
Minimum:	13862	23444	253	0	6	1
2.5%-tile:	0	0	0	0	0	1
25%-tile:	0	0	0	0	0	1
Median: 	0	0	0	0	0	1
75%-tile:	0	0	0	0	0	1
97.5%-tile:	0	0	0	0	0	1
Maximum:	13862	23444	253	0	6	1
Mean:	13862	23444	253	0	6
# of Seqs:	1

Output File Names: 
ecoli16.pcr.summary

## so start = 13862 and stop = 23444
# now we use those to trim out database just to the region where our primers bind by running anohter in silico PCR
pcr.seqs(fasta=silva.nr_v119.align, start=13862, end=23444, keepdots=F, processors=30)

Output File Names: 
silva.nr_v119.pcr.align


It took 19 secs to screen 153307 sequences.

## rename the output file: 
system(mv silva.nr_v119.pcr.align silva.v4.fasta) 

summary.seqs(fasta=silva.v4.fasta) 

output:
		Start	End	NBases	Ambigs	Polymer	NumSeqs

Output File Names: 
silva.v4.summary


## now align to customised database: 

align.seqs(fasta=stability.trim.contigs.good.unique.fasta, reference=silva.v4.fasta, flip=T) 

## from here continue with MiSeq SOP
