# -------------------Making Krona plots from Mothur data-----------------#

# used this webpage mostly

# http://mealybugs-metagenomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/13_krona_output.html

# Go to this page and make sure you have the 5 things they list. 
# I did this on an Ubuntu computer so it already has lxml, you just have to install it using following

sudo pip install lxml

# For Krona - download the .tar folder from here: https://github.com/marbl/Krona/wiki/Downloads
# extract all the files then navigate to that folder by cd and execute the following: 
 
sudo ./install.pl

# (actually i made a specific working dir for this and put everything in the same folder)

# for Krona go to 
# https://github.com/accaldwell/mothur_krona
# click green button 'clone or download' and Download .zip folder of mothur-krona stuff
# again unzip in your wkdir

# give yourself permission to run the python script of krona

chmod u+x mothur_krona_XML.py

# lastly, copy and paste your stability.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.pick.pick.an.unique_list.0.03.cons.tax.summary
# file from mothur folder into your current krona wkdir

# run following
# note - in my case, I have chosen to give the output file the name krona_output.xml

python ./mothur_krona_XML.py /home/femlab/Cam/KronaTestLimecDNA/stability.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.pick.pick.an.unique_list.0.03.cons.tax.summary > /home/femlab/Cam/KronaTestLimecDNA/krona_output.xml

# if no error, will just return a blank screen when he's finished. (if error see end of this doc)
# then we convert this xml to an html so we can open it online


ktImportXML -o krona_11Aug.html krona_output.xml

# where the output file will be called krona_11Aug.html

# out of terminal, go to your krona folder and find this file, double click and it will open web browser
# and Ta Dah!!

## if you get an error like "from: can't read /var/mail/lxml"
## then open the python script of caldwell
# delete first line with author name and replace it with a line that tells computer where to look for python 
# this line is called A shebang which is the first line of the file. Its what the system is looking for in order to execute a file.

# this is what I added (INCLUDING the hashmark at the beginning)

#!/home/femlab/anaconda2/bin/python python


# if you don't know the route to where your python is then go to terminal and type 

which python

# and it'll tell you.
