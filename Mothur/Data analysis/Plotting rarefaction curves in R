## R code for plotting rarefaction curves created in Mothur

## Using R studio

## the releveant mothur file here is "stability.an.groups.rarefaction"
## BUT we need to trim a bit as Output in mothur consists of a table of # Seqs 
# vs # otus for each sample
## each sample gets 3 outputs -> no of OTUs; no of OTUS with Low confidence interval
## and number of OTUS when using high CI
## I removed low CI and high CI so I just had one set of rarefaction values for each
## Sample by doing this...


# read in data as it comes out of mothur
data <- read.table("stability.an.groups.rarefaction", header=T)
attach(data)
head(data)

# subset data to choose just the columns whose names start with hci
data2 <- subset(data, select = grep("hci", names(data))) 
# check using head that you now only have these colums
head(data2)

# now we are missing "numsampled column" and I don't know how to add it using R
# so we will write out the table we made and call it RarefactionHCI.txt
write.table(data2, "RarefactionHCI.txt", sep="\t")
# you will find this file in your R working dir
# open in excel, insert new colum and add numsampled column from 
# full rarefaction file (by copy&paste); saved file
# as "cDNA_HCI.rarefaction" and used that for next steps



## 1. Set Working Directory (WD) (done in Session option)
## 2. Install necessary libraries ie ggplot and reshape2 (in Tools Option)
## 3. Then load them using library command

library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)

## import data - make sure not directly from excel, do via notepad
## file = your file name and make sure file is in your WD
## Header = T means R uses top row as column titles not data values

data3<-read.table(file="cDNA_HCI.rarefaction", header=T)

## to use ggplot data neads to be rearranged
## do this using melt function with first arguement = name of data set
## second argement = name of 1st column (ie what will become x axis)

melted3 = melt(data3, id.vars="numsampled")

## now make plot using ggplot() with geom_lime command
## Add colour = variable to give each line a different colour
r <- ggplot() + geom_line(data=melted3, aes(x=numsampled, y=value, group=variable, colour=variable))

## add Title and axis labels to plot

r2 <- r +  labs(x="Number of Sequences", y = "Number of OTUs", title = "High CI Refraction curves for cDNA samples") 

## change background of plot to white with theme_bw()
## change title size and spacing with theme()

r3<- r2 + theme_bw() + theme(plot.title = element_text(size=20, face="bold", vjust=2))

## print r3 to see new plot 
r3
