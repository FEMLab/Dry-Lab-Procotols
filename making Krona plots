Making Krona plots

Go to 
https://github.com/marbl/Krona/wiki/Downloads

Option 1: Krona excel template. 

Can download this, unzip and then open in excel making sure macros are enabled. Fill in sheet and then click create Krona near top of excel sheet. 

Option 2. Use krona tools. 

Download KronaTools .tar
Extract it and then open a terminal and navigate to that folder. That will be your working directory and all files you want to read in need to be in that folder. 

Finish install by running:
On mac:  sudo ./install.pl
On PC: ./install.pl

You can read in different types

But I just did .txt files. 

These text files should consist of 3 or more columns, separated by tabs.
Column 1 contains numbers/counts/relative abundances; column two is level one of the Krona (eg phylum) column 3 is level two (eg Class) and so on with how ever many levels you want. 

Now, in your terminal once making sure you are in working directory run the following command: 
ktImportText myFileName.txt
press enter and it will output a .html file of your krona plot to your working directory. It will have a default name. Be sure to change before running again. 

If you have a few samples that you want the first level of the Krona plot to be coloured the same for the same levels (eg phylum proteobacteria always pink) then read all files names in at once eg:
ktImportText myFile1.txt myFile2.txt myFile3.txt
